# Welcome to the *Principia* Rewrite project website!

## Summary
This website hosts updates for the *Principia* Rewrite project. Our aim is to facilitate academic and public engagement with Whitehead and Russell's landmark work on logic and the foundations of mathematics. The project aims to do this by digitizing, mapping, and analyzing their work.

## Updates

The *Principia* Rewrite project has a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LogicalAtomist/principia). Regular updates and the source code are made available there, whereas project milestones will be announced here. As of February 2021, the project has produced:

1. a [LaTeX] package, [`principia`](https://ctan.org/pkg/principia), for typesetting any symbol in *Principia*'s Volume I
2. a `Coq` encoding of *Principia*'s propositional logic (\*1-\*5), running about 110 pages of code (4,600 lines of code)

And there are further developments to come: the top priority on our project agenda is to build a map of the first five chapters ("starred numbers") of *Principia*.

## People
